# Bulls & Cows Game

- JAVA console game

author: Sergey Germanov

I added some ASCII art (http://ascii.co.uk/) to make the interface of the game more appealing to play.

I used draw.io (https://www.draw.io/) to draw diagrams.

You are playing the following Bulls and Cows game with the computer: Computer chooses a number and ask you to guess what the number is. Each time you make a guess, the computer provides a hint that indicates how many digits in said guess match computer secret number exactly in both digit and position (called "bulls") and how many digits match the secret number but locate in the wrong position (called "cows"). Computer will use successive guesses and hints to eventually derive the secret number.

For example:
Secret number: "1807"
Friend's guess: "7810"

Hint: 1 bull and 3 cows. (The bull is 8, the cows are 0, 1 and 7.)
